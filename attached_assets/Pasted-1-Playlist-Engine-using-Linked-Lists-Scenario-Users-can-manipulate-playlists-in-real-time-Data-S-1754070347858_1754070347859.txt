1. Playlist Engine using Linked Lists
Scenario: Users can manipulate playlists in real-time.

Data Structure: Doubly Linked List.

Functions to Implement:

add_song(title, artist, duration)

delete_song(index)

move_song(from_index, to_index)

reverse_playlist()

Purpose:

Models real-world dynamic playlist editing.

Reinforces pointer manipulation and list ordering.

2. Playback History using Stack
Scenario: Users can “undo” recently played songs to re-queue them.

Data Structure: Stack.

Functions to Implement:

Maintain playback stack.

undo_last_play() – re-adds last played song to playlist.

Purpose:

Demonstrates LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior.

Enables simple history-based control flow.

3. Song Rating Tree using Binary Search Tree (BST)
Scenario: Songs categorized and searchable by user ratings (1–5 stars).

Data Structure: BST with rating buckets.

Functions to Implement:

insert_song(song, rating)

search_by_rating(rating)

delete_song(song_id)

Purpose:

Enables structured searching and categorization.

Applies BST logic to real-world recommendation.

4. Instant Song Lookup using HashMap
Scenario: Users can search by song title or ID instantly.

Data Structure: HashMap.

Functions to Implement:

Store and sync song_id → metadata and title → metadata.

Sync with playlist updates.

Purpose:

Ensures constant-time lookup.

Demonstrates real-time syncing and key-based access.

5. Time-based Sorting using Merge/Quick Sort
Scenario: Sort playlist by title, duration, or recently added.

Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort.

Features to Implement:

Sort by multiple criteria.

Compare with built-in sorting for performance.

Purpose:

Understand and apply advanced sorting.

Explore time-space tradeoffs.

6. Playback Optimization via Space-Time Analysis
Scenario: Optimize memory usage and performance.

What to Do:

Annotate all core methods with time & space complexity.

Optimize operations (e.g., lazy reversal, node swaps).

Purpose:

Reinforces asymptotic analysis.

Builds engineering mindset for scalable systems.

7. System Snapshot Module (Live Dashboard)
Scenario: Debugging interface for system stats.

What to Show:

Top 5 longest songs.

Most recently played songs.

Song count grouped by rating.

Techniques:

Tree traversal, HashMap, and Sorting.

Function to Implement:

export_snapshot() – returns live dashboard data.

Purpose:

Integrate multiple DSA skills.

Emphasize reasoning about application state and aggregation.
